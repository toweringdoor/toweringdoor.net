    Many hispanics come to America for a better life, once they make it into America. They have to find any job that will take them in.
    The issue with this is that many of these immigrants aren't allowed to work here legally. So these people have to be very desperate in finding a job.
    They end up having to work heavy labor jobs that some Americans wouldn't want to work. Which does benefit our economy since there are positions
    that need to be filled, but no one wants to work them. On the other hand, this is also bad for the immigrants since some may not be fit to endure the long work hours or the weather in some places.

<h3><b>Negligence from Employers towards immigrants</b></h3>

    According to the image above, Hispanic/Latinos have been the most affected with the highest fatal injuries out of all the other ethnicities reported. 
    Negligence from the employers can very easily attribute to these high statistics. <a href=https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/03/14/trapped-on-wisconsin-farms-the-hidden-plight-of-trafficked-workers/>This article</a> goes through the story of one man,
    M. Paredes, and his experience coming to America and being able to work illegally. There were negative effects with this as he had to work 10hr shifts and did not have any precautions towards safety since the employer was reckless.
    How did this man decide to work for this person? Well, they were offered a way for him to get his citizenship. Shortly after, he dealt with physical and verbal abuse from his employer. 
    M. Paredes unfortunately got severly injured which left him permenantly disabled.

    Another example of negligence from employers is there could be a very risky task that someone needs to handle. They might not want to give that role to someone who could easily get workmans comp
    or some other insurnace claim. So they may pass it off onto an immigrant who does not get any of those safeguards and risk getting injured or worse get fatally hurt in the process.
