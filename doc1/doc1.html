    Many hispanics come to America for a better life, once they make it into America. They have to find any job that will take them in.
    The issue with this is that many of these immigrants aren't allowed to work here legally. So these people have to be very desperate in finding a job.
    They end up having to work heavy labor jobs that some Americans wouldn't want to work. Which does benefit our economy since there are positions
    that need to be filled, but no one wants to work them. On the other hand, this is also bad for the immigrants since some may not be fit to endure the long work hours or the weather in some places.

<h3><b>Negligence from Employers towards immigrants</b></h3>

    According to the image above, Hispanic/Latinos have been the most affected with the highest fatal injuries out of all the other ethnicities reported. 
    Negligence from the employers can very easily attribute to these high statistics. <a href=https://wisconsinexaminer.com/2024/03/14/trapped-on-wisconsin-farms-the-hidden-plight-of-trafficked-workers/>This article</a> goes through the story of one man,
    M. Paredes, and his experience coming to America and being able to work illegally. There were negative effects with this as he had to work 10hr shifts and did not have any precautions towards safety since the employer was reckless.
    How did this man decide to work for this person? Well, they were offered a way for him to get his citizenship. Shortly after, he dealt with physical and verbal abuse from his employer. 
    M. Paredes unfortunately got severly injured which left him permenantly disabled.

    Another example of negligence from employers is there could be a very risky task that someone needs to handle. They might not want to give that role to someone who could easily get workmans comp
    or some other insurnace claim. So they may pass it off onto an immigrant who does not get any of those safeguards and risk getting injured or worse get fatally hurt in the process.

    UMOS, also known as United Migrant Opportunity Services, is a non-profit advocacy organization that provides programs
    for the under-served population. These services include employment, educational, housing and health opportunities.
    In this scenario, they respond to the many cases revolving the workplace negligence that these people are encountering.

    In 2017, the police raided the Borzynski Farm near Racine, WI. Members of the contractor company were convicted of running a
    labor trafficing operation on the farm and were sentenced in federal court. There was an exploit of the H2A visa program.
    Saul Garcia had brought them in from Mexico but took away their visas and passports, then proceeded to give them fake documents leaving them vulnerable
    for deportation.

<h3><b>Smuggling, Drugs, and Arms trade done by the Cartels</b></h3>

    Another major issue in this country is besides the harassment and taking advantage of people in businesses. There are some 
    cartels who are in the United States that use these people for their benefit. For the most part, a lot of the issues we have
    is the drug running operations. Mexico has been fighting a long war with these cartels over many issues but drugs have affected our
    country in the process. 
</p>

<p>
    One unfortunate example of these issues is the human smuggling that happens around the border. Whether they are putting people in these trailers
    and either getting across the border or leaving them around left to die, or a massive group who crosses the border by foot. The desert are rough
    conditions, and most people aren't prepared for the long walk until they are in a city. So a lot of people can pass out from dehydration. 
</p>

<p>
    Another prime example of cartels taking advantage of the desperate people who want to cross the border. There are some 
    parts past the border that are territorial to these cartels. And they impose territorial fees to these other criminal orgs.
    At some point you had to pay a criminal organization just to cross the border, but that didn't garuntee your safety. As it turns out
    some of these people were left for dead or never made it to their destination. In some cases these people are forced to join
    the cartel and do illegal activities for them, at the cost of them losing their family if they were to fight back.
