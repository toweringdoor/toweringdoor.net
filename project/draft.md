### __The rough life for Hispanic/Latinos who crossed the border__

<p>
There is currently an issue with immigration in the United States. There is many people who are wanting to cross, but our system is not able to process people fast enough. Which results in long wait times to get across the border. This is how some people end up jumping across the border illegally. Whether it's lack of the necessary funds or desperation, some people will risk their lives to come to America.

According to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/09/27/key-findings-about-us-immigrants/sr_24-07-22_immigrant-facts_7/">Pew Research Center</a>, The job opportunites in the United States grew by double digit percentages but there was no influx of immigrants. Thus, this resulted in many positions not being fullfilled since not even the American people wanted to work some of these jobs.
