    One of the major issues we have in our country is securing the border properly. 
    Whether its in regards to the security of our borders, or the vetting process of allowing people in.
    Some part of it isn't working as it should. We can see this from crime statistics and the presence
    of cartels in our country. 
</p>

<p>
    An organization that I researched during this project was Voces de la Frontera, which translates to Voices of the Border.
    Their purpose is providing a voice for the low-wage workers, immigrants, and youth who wish to protect our civil rights and workers rights.
    They also provide services like getting help with green cards, learning the English language, information about DACA, and being able to understand your rights as an immigrant.

<h3><b>Voces de la Frontera and their contributions to this issue</b></h3>

    Voces de la Frontera ran a campaign to combat the up and cominglaw 287g, which in simple terms made any local law enforcement officer able to investigate immigration status of these vulnerable people.
    The major issue with this is that it tends to promote racial profiling and separation of families. Voces de la Frontera were able to push back this law in the city of Milwaukee with the help 
    of many protesters. 
</p>

<p>
    Voces de la Frontera were also pushing for drivers licenses for all people, as currently it is impossible for immigrants to get a drivers license. In 2005, the US Congress passed the Real ID act
    which basically stated that before anyone were able to get a drivers license/state ID, they would have their immigration status checked prior. Obviously if someone crossed illegaly, they wont 
    have the sufficient papers to get a drivers license. Therefore, they have to run the risk of driving without a license and insurance while racking up tickets since they need to get to work and
    their home.

<p>
    Continuing what was stated in the previous paragraph, our dairy industry relies on these immigrants to be able to work these jobs. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/wisconsin-dairy-undocumented-immigrants-drivers-licenses">This article</a>
    published by ProPublica showcases the struggles of these hispanics who have to live with not being able to have a drivers license. These immigrants are able to own and register cars under their name
    but they are not allowed to drive them unless they want to be hit with heavy penalties. In this article they state this person had a fine of $200, which was a whole days of work for them over 14 hours.
    The issue with these job locations is they are in need of a car. America is a car centric country and most people see a car as a necessity to travel. Especially when these farms are outside major cities
    where public transport is not as viable and Ubers will cost much more.

<h3><b>COVID-19 and its effects on our country's economy</b></h3>

<p>
    Another issue we have in our country is labor shortage. After Covid-19, we had a huge spike in layoffs and that had resulted in a lot of missing workers. Since this was a global pandemic happening,
    not many people were able to migrate to our country for a while. This really hurt our economy for a few years and with the highest unemployment rate since the Great Recession of 2007-08. 
</p>

<p>
    During the height of the pandemic in 2020, President Donald Trump at the time came forward and issued a suspension of new immigrants who wished to enter
    our country with valid papers. This had gone into effect while everything else surrounding covid was also going on such as mass job layoffs, lockdowns with limited 
    businesses open, essential workers vs non-essential workers, and inflation in our economy.

    Looking at the line graph to the right, we can see that during the COVID-19 pandemic, the lower class which would include immigrants were greatly affected.
    <br><br>    
    Another issue when it came to these low paying jobs, is that they were also not safe from COVID-19 and its 
    severity. It was reported by a meat processing plant that it became a hotspot with more than 1000 cases testing 
    positive for COVID-19. In Nebraska, there was a study conducted that showed there was a 19% infection rate among workers 
    between April to July 2020. Since the virus was spreading in food industries, this unfortunately went down the chain
    and some communities were affected from it.
</p>

<p>
    What also didn't help for these immigrants during the time, is that it was already very hard for people to get
    access to their healthcare providers. Immigrants couldn't risk getting sick since a lot of them didn't have any
    health insurance and any medical emergency was a big deal like it is for anyone with no insurance.
